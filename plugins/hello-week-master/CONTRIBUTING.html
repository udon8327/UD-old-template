<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mauroreisvieira/hello-week/issues">issue tracker</a> is the preferred channel for bug reports, feature requests, and submitting pull requests.</p>
<p>Please do not use the issue tracker for personal support requests.</p>
<p>Stack Overflow <strong><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hello-week">Hello Week</a></strong> is a better place to get help.</p>
<h4 id="setting-up-your-development-environment">Setting up your development environment</h4>
<p>You&#39;ll need a recent version of <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> to work this project.</p>
<p>Once node is installed, simply clone our repository (or your fork of it) and run <code>yarn install</code> or <code>npm install</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ git clone git@github.com:mauroreisvieira/hello-week.git
  $ cd hello-week &amp;&amp; yarn install
</code></pre>
<h4 id="running-development-server">Running development server</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ yarn run watch # Listen changes and Hello Week.
  $ yarn run demos:start # Run the files in demos folder.
  $ yarn run demos:watch # Listen changes inside demos folder.
  $ open http://localhost:8082/# # Open the browser to see the demos.
</code></pre>
<p><code>yarn run demos:start</code> runs a webpack-dev-server instance that uses demos/ as its content base.</p>
<p>This should aid you in initial development of a component. It&#39;s served on port 8080.</p>
<h4 id="building">Building</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ yarn run build # Cleans out build/ and builds.
  $ yarn run demos:build # Cleans out build/ and builds demo CSS/JS.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="linting-testing">Linting / Testing</h4>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ yarn run lint:ts # Lints typescript using tslint
  $ yarn run:lint:scss # Lints (S)CSS using stylelint

  $ yarn run test #  Only runs the mocha tests
</code></pre>
<h4 id="feature-requests">Feature requests</h4>
<p>Feature requests are welcome, but please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
It&#39;s up to you to make a strong case to convince the project&#39;s developers of the merits of this feature.</p>
<p>To get approval for your feature request, please create an issue on the issue tracker with as much detail and context as possible.</p>
<h4 id="reporting-bugs">Reporting Bugs</h4>
<p>A bug is a demonstrable, reproducible problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!</p>
<p><strong>Guidelines for bug reports:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.</li>
<li>Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest <strong>develop</strong> branch in the repository.</li>
<li>Isolate the problem - you NEED to provide a live example — ideally also create a reduced test case.</li>
</ol>
<p>This <a href="https://codepen.io/anon/pen/prvbMp">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/h8x8bvn9/2/">JSFiddle</a> are helpful templates you can fork or clone.</p>
<h4 id="submitting-pull-requests">Submitting Pull requests</h4>
<p>Good pull requests are a amazing help.</p>
<p>They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.</p>
<p>Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:</p>
<p><a href="https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/hello-week.git
  $ cd hello-week
  $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/mauroreisvieira/hello-week.git
</code></pre>
<p>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ git checkout develop
  $ git pull [--rebase] upstream develop
</code></pre>
<p>Create a new topic branch (off the main project <strong>develop</strong> branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Use Git&#39;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive rebase</a> feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.</p>
<p>Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ git pull [--rebase] upstream develop
</code></pre>
<p>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-bash">  $ git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a> with a clear title and description against the <strong>develop</strong> branch.</p>
<p>By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owner to license your work under the terms of the <a href="LICENSE">MIT License</a>.</p>
